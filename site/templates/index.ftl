				One of the best descriptions was given in the 2009 JavaOne
				Conference PDF:

				"The Java Champions community was started by Sun at the 2005
				JavaOne conference to recognize key influencers in the Java
				community. Java Champions are influential Rock Star presenters
				and Java technology educators, authors, and consultants; Java
				platform event organizers; and others within the Java technology
				ecosystem. For the third consecutive year, Java Champions have
				contributed to the JavaOne conference process as technical
				reviewers for paper submissions, have been recognized for their
				achievements, and have shared their thoughts about the state of
				the Java platform at their BOF sessions."
