= Bylaws of The Java Champions Community

== Article I: Name and Purpose

=== Section 1: Name
The name of this organization shall be the Java Champions Community, hereinafter referred to as "the Group."

=== Section 2: Purpose
The purpose of the Group is to recognize key influencers in the Java community, provide advice, support and advance the adoption of Java technologies.

=== Section 3: Trademark
The Group name includes the word "Java", which is trademarked by Oracle.

== Article II: Membership

=== Section 1: Membership Status
Members of the Group can fall into three categories:

 1. Renounced: Members that have chosen to leave the Group

 2. Alumni: Members that have joined Oracle after becoming Java Champions

 3. Active: Members that are neither Renounced nor Alumni


To participate in any Group activity, a member must be active unless otherwise noted in these bylaws.

=== Section 2: Eligibility
Membership is open to individuals who have been nominated by at least two current Group members and approved by the Group and are not Oracle Employees.

=== Section 3: Nomination
A Group member nominates an individual by submitting the nomination form. The nomination form is created and maintained by the Group. The nomination requires both a nominator and a co-nominator.

=== Section 4: Discussion Period
Once a nomination has been submitted and processed by Oracle's Java Champion Team, it will be announced on the Group Mailing List. This initiates a two-week discussion period during which Group members can discuss the candidate without voting.

The purpose of the discussion period is raise any concerns about the candidate, and facilitate discussions and/or the shifting of opinions without committing to a vote. This process also helps keeping the voting period purely for voting on a candidate instead of discussing the candidate's merits and/or shortcomings.

=== Section 5: Voting Period
After the discussion period, a two-week voting period begins. The start of the voting process is announced via an email from Oracle's Java Champions Team, creating a voting email thread. Group members vote on the Mailing List by replying to the thread, using "+1" for approval, "-1" for disapproval, and "0" for non-commitment.

Voting is not compulsory, so Group members may choose not to participate in a candidate nomination.

=== Section 6: Negative Votes
A vote of "-1" carries significant weight against the nomination. Group members voting "-1" must provide a reason for their disapproval.

=== Section 7: Results
After the two-week voting period, the results are tallied:
- Two negative ("-1") votes will disqualify a candidate.
- A minimum of three "+1" votes are required to confirm a candidate as a Java Champion, and becoming a new member of the group.

=== Section 8: Rights and Responsibilities
Members have the right to attend meetings, vote on the Group matters, and participate in the Group activities.

=== Section 9: Renouncing Membership
A member may renounce their membership at any time by announcing their intent to renounce to the Group mailing list.

=== Section 10: Oracle Employees
A member that starts working for Oracle would transition from being an Active Member to Alumni. If the member leaves Oracle, its Active status is re-instated.
