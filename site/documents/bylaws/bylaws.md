# Bylaws of The Java Champions Community

## Article I: Name and Purpose

### Section 1: Name
The name of this organization shall be the Java Champions Community, hereinafter referred to as "the Group."

### Section 2: Purpose
The purpose of the Group is to recognize key influencers in the Java community, provide advice, advance the adoption, and support the Java language and platform.

### Section 3: Trademark
The Java Champions group operates under the Java Champions Oracle Trademark; therefore, these bylaws must be considered in the context of the Trademark.

## Article II: Membership

### Section 1: Eligibility
Membership is open to individuals who have been nominated by a current Java Champion Member and approved by the Java Champion Group and are not Oracle Employees.

### Section 2: Nomination
A current Java Champion nominates an individual by submitting the form on [Typeform](https://form.typeform.com/to/dMS1s8). The nomination requires both a nominator and a co-nominator.

### Section 3: Discussion Period
Once a nomination has been submitted and processed by Oracle's Java Champion Team, it will be announced on the Java Champions Mailing List. This initiates a two-week discussion period during which Java Champions can discuss the candidate without voting.

### Section 4: Voting Period
After the discussion period, a two-week voting period begins. The start of the voting process is announced via an email from Oracle's Java Champions Team, creating a voting email thread. Java Champions vote on the Mailing List by replying to the thread, using "+1" for approval, "-1" for disapproval, and "0" for non-commitment.

Voting is not compulsory, so Java Champions may choose not to participate in a candidate nomination.

### Section 5: Negative Votes
A vote of "-1" carries significant weight against the nomination. Java Champions voting "-1" must provide a reason for their disapproval.

### Section 6: Results
After the two-week voting period, the results are tallied.
- Two negative ("-1") votes will disqualify a candidate.
- A minimum of three "+1" votes are required to confirm a candidate as a Java Champion.

### Section 7: Rights and Responsibilities
Members have the right to attend meetings, vote on Group matters, and participate in Group activities. They are responsible for upholding the Group's mission and adhering to these bylaws.

### Section 8: Renouncing Membership
A member may renounce their membership at any time by submitting a pull request to remove themselves from the [Java Champions List](https://github.com/aalmiray/java-champions/blob/main/java-champions.yml).

## Article III: Meetings

### Section 1: In-Person Meetings
In-person meetings may be held at conferences or events and can occur organically without prior announcements. Attendance at these meetings is not compulsory.

### Section 2: Online Meetings
Online meetings can be organized by any Java Champion Member. Attendance at these meetings is not compulsory.

## Article IV: Amendments

### Section 1: Proposal
Amendments to these bylaws may be proposed by any member.

### Section 2: Notice
Proposed amendments must be submitted to the Java Champions Mailing List and as a pull request to the [Java Champions Document GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aalmiray/java-champions).

### Section 3: Discussion Period
After the amendment pull request has been submitted, a one-week discussion period is set aside for discussion and amendments within the Java Champions Mailing List.

### Section 4: Voting Period
Following the discussion period, a one-week voting period is set aside for open polling through the mailing list.

### Section 5: Voting Procedure
Voting on amendments to these bylaws shall be conducted by secret poll to ensure both transparency and privacy. Each member's vote shall be recorded without disclosing individual voting preferences. The results, including the total number of votes for and against, shall be documented by merging (if passed) or closing (if failed) the pull request amending the bylaws.

### Section 6: Approval
Amendments must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the members voting in the poll.
